setup
- define seven ints for the seven pins on the board transmitting input to the PLC
- define seven ints for the seven pins on the board receiving input from the PLC
- start serial communication with the PC

loop (assuming the python output format of the sample)
- read the first four strings of data from serial to get the inputs, outputs, and timers strings
  - parse the 'inputs' string for the bool value of each provided input
    - set the input pins to high or low based on these values
  - parse the 'outputs' string for the bool values of each provided output
    - read the actual output from the PLC to the Arduino and compare them to the expected output string
