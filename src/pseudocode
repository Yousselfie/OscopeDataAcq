global variables
- there are 52 digital pins available to use as GPIO on the Arduino Mega, as we are avoiding using pins 0 and 1 since communication is happening over "Serial0" (or just "Serial")
-- this means there are 26 for input/output each
--- allocate pins 2-27 for input and 28-53 for ouput


setup
- start serial communication with the PC

loop (assuming the python output format of the sample)
- read the first five strings of data from serial to get the path num, header, inputs, outputs, and timers strings
  - parse the 'inputs' string for the bool value of each provided input
    - set the PLC input pins (output pins relative to Arduino) to high (OFF, since normally closed relay) or low (ON) based on these values
  - parse the 'outputs' string for the bool values of each provided output
    - read the actual output from the PLC to the Arduino and compare them to the expected output string
